\section{Munna Bhai MBBS}
The story line of this movie revolves around Munna Bhai (played by Sanjay Dutt) and his sidekick Circuit (played by Arshad Warsi). Munna Bhai, whose real name is Murli Prasad Sharma, becomes a bhai after coming to Mumbai. His father (played by Sunil Dutt) wants him to become a doctor. Every time his father visits him in the city, his dhobi-ghaat place has to be transformed into a hospital to show that he is a real doctor. \\ \\

But once Munna Bhai's father finds out the reality, he is heart-broken and leaves. This incident pushes Munna Bhai to prove a point and he gets himself an admission to become a doctor to show his worth to his father. He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college, furthermore he is also in love with his daughter (played by Gracy Singh). \\ \\
The story focuses on how people in the hospital need to be loved and appreciated. Arshad Warsi provides his dose of humour after every few scenes. Songs weren't that great except perhaps a couple of them. \\ \\
Sanjay Dutt does justification to his role as the Bhai. Arshad Warsi in the supporting role also acted very well. All in all, this is a very good movie if a good dose of laughter is what one is looking for.


\section{3 Idiots}
3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect representatives of the new age Indian students who are non-conformist, questioning givens. They choose to live their lives on their own terms. But due to societal and parental pressure they are forced to have educational paths that they refuse to chose so that they do not become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as great successes who shaped the world by taking the roads less travelled.\\

The film begins with the entry of the trio in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which decides who the leader of the gang is going to be and in the movie, it is the new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends would fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's highly competitive, high-pressure and almost cruel educational rat-race, but also tutors them with several life mantras. Some of these matras include ``running after excellence and not success'', ``questioning and not blindly accepting the givens'', ``inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming'' and most importantly ``following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference''.


I'm an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.

\section{Swarnadeep's Review}
The movie Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. is an exemplary example of how a humerous movie can be made. The movie is filled with jokes and comical scenes every second minute. There are instances when the mood of the movie changes from the humerous one to a serious one. And such changes are more than welcome as the audience goes through a lot of emotions. The character development of the lead characters is tremendous. The audience, by the end of the movie, starts to resonate with the feelings of both the lead actors and thus the movie ends with the audience having happy faces and wondering how quickly the 2.5 hours went by. This movie is a must watch for all people who are looking forward to a jovial session of movie watching. 10/10 would recomment. \\ \\
The movie 3 idiots show some major life lessons in ways that the audience not only enjoys, but also relates to. There are a lot of humerous elements to the story too. The story revolves around a group of 3 college students, their hardships, their struggles and their journey to become successful in their respective fields. The fact that the movie not only showcases the ups of the college life but also the downs, like the scene when Raju attempts suicide, makes this movie a great one. While watching the movie, one goes through a plethora of emotions, ranging from sorrow, grief to joy and happiness. The movie also focuses on the rat race that our education system is. This movie is a must watch for all college students and everyone who thinks he/she is stuck in their life and are not going forward. 10/10 would recommend.
