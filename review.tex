\section{Munna Bhai MBBS}
The story line of this movie revolves around Munna Bhai (played by Sanjay Dutt) and his sidekick Circuit (played by Arshad Warsi). Munna Bhai, whose real name is Murli Prasad Sharma, becomes a bhai after coming to Mumbai. His father (played by Sunil Dutt) wants him to become a doctor. Every time his father visits him in the city, his dhobi-ghaat place has to be transformed into a hospital to show that he is a real doctor. \\ \\

But once Munna Bhai's father finds out the reality, he is heart-broken and leaves. This incident pushes Munna Bhai to prove a point and he gets himself an admission to become a doctor to show his worth to his father. He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college, furthermore he is also in love with his daughter (played by Gracy Singh).
