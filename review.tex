\section{Munna Bhai MBBS}
The story line of this movie revolves around Munna Bhai (played by Sanjay Dutt) and his sidekick Circuit (played by Arshad Warsi). Munna Bhai, whose real name is Murli Prasad Sharma, becomes a bhai after coming to Mumbai. His father (played by Sunil Dutt) wants him to become a doctor. Every time his father visits him in the city, his dhobi-ghaat place has to be transformed into a hospital to show that he is a real doctor. \\ \\

But once Munna Bhai's father finds out the reality, he is heart-broken and leaves. This incident pushes Munna Bhai to prove a point and he gets himself an admission to become a doctor to show his worth to his father. He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college, furthermore he is also in love with his daughter (played by Gracy Singh). \\ \\
The story focuses on how people in the hospital need to be loved and appreciated. Arshad Warsi provides his dose of humour after every few scenes. Songs weren't that great except perhaps a couple of them. \\ \\
Sanjay Dutt does justification to his role as the Bhai. Arshad Warsi in the supporting role also acted very well. All in all, this is a very good movie if a good dose of laughter is what one is looking for.


\section{3 Idiots}
3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect representatives of the new age Indian students who are non-conformist, questioning givens. They choose to live their lives on their own terms. But due to societal and parental pressure they are forced to have educational paths that they refuse to chose so that they do not become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as great successes who shaped the world by taking the roads less travelled.\\

The film begins with the entry of the trio in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which decides who the leader of the gang is going to be and in the movie, it is the new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends would fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's highly competitive, high-pressure and almost cruel educational rat-race, but also tutors them with several life mantras. Some of these matras include ``running after excellence and not success'', ``questioning and not blindly accepting the givens'', ``inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming'' and most importantly ``following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference''.


I'm an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.

\section{Hariom's review}
\subsection{Munna Bhai MBBS}
Inspired by the Hollywood movie 'Patch Adam', 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' tells the comedic story of a thug who wants to become a doctor. The film has its major share of comedic moments and its dramatic moments. It is indeed an entertaining film with the famously lovable characters like Munnabhai and Circuit. 
\\
Rajkumar Hirani may have taken the idea of an older outsider wanting to become a doctor from 'Patch Adams' but in essence 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' is its own film and it is the performances and comedy that make it worth the watch because most the dramatic moments are a little over the top. While the dialogue in the comedic scenes are witty and hilarious, the ones in the dramatic scenes are a mess.
\\
Sanjay Dutt totally nails Munnabhai. It's hard to picture anyone else in the title role. The actor does full justice. It was nice to see Sunil Dutt after a long time and that too as father to his own son. The actor has a strong presence, even in a brief role. Gracy Singh is cute and adorable. Jimmy Shergill is awesome and holds his own as Zaheer and Boman Irani too does very well. However, it is Arshad Warsi who steals the show in a breakthrough performance as one of the most memorable film characters of recent time, Circuit.
\\
Most of the songs are well balanced and are good additions to the film. I found Munnabhai's romantic ballad hilarious when he tries to convince the suicider to cut the crap. On the technical side, it's alright. On the whole this is one enjoyable flick.

\subsection{3 Idiots}
The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...
