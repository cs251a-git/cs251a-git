\section{Munna Bhai MBBS}
The story line of this movie revolves around Munna Bhai (played by Sanjay Dutt) and his sidekick Circuit (played by Arshad Warsi). Munna Bhai, whose real name is Murli Prasad Sharma, becomes a bhai after coming to Mumbai. His father (played by Sunil Dutt) wants him to become a doctor. Every time his father visits him in the city, his dhobi-ghaat place has to be transformed into a hospital to show that he is a real doctor.

I remember very well, when I first saw the promos of this movie on TV, I was considering it as yet another timepass-govinda-sanju-type-comedy- movie. The night next to its release, there was a party in Mumbai having guests like Nasiruddin Shah and Om Puri! Mr. Shah stated "This movie will go ahead of Vaastav." I was surprised like hell! Vaastav!!! Went to theatre the same week and watched it. GREAT MOVIE! I can't mention a point against it. Everything was simply superb. If we talk about acting! Even the sweeper or peon acted far better than the lead-actors of other Indian movies.



\section{3 Idiots}

"Whatever the problem in life is... just say to yourself 'Aal Izz Well'.. This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it.." "Chase Excellence and success will follow".. " Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...



3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by.

The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.
