\section{Munna bhai M.B.B.S}
The year 2003 has witnessed several new directors enter the fray. Coincidentally, the two releases of this week are also directed by first-timers. A few names left an impression, some made a hasty exit.
Editor Rajkumar Hirani, who makes his bow as a director with MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S., handles a complex subject in his debut vehicle. A wacko theme, the flick offers laughter in abundance, has moments that melt your heart and bring a tear in your eye, plus propagates a message  love can overcome all sorrows.
\\
\\
That's precisely why MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. works!
\\
\\
Munnabhai [Sanjay Dutt] lives with his gang in the bylanes of a dhobi ghat in Mumbai, takes pride in being a 'social worker' [they actually settle 'financial disputes' through dadagiri] and enjoys his booze, babes,
\\
\\
Munna's father, Hari Prasad Sharma [Sunil Dutt], an upright, moralistic man, believes that his son is actually a doctor running a charity hospital. Every year, when his parents arrive, Munna and his gang bathe, shave, don white coats and stethoscopes and pretend to be diligent doctors.
\\
\\
But the clever charade falls apart. Hari Prasad Sharma runs into an old friend, Dr. Asthana [Boman Irani], who has a daughter called Suman [Gracy Singh]. The two decide that their children, both doctors, would make a perfect match. Munna tries hard to save the situation, but his father discovers the truth. And all hell breaks loose.
\\
\\
Hari Prasad Sharma, now broken by the truth, removes his white spotless pagdi and cries. Munnabhai then takes a decision that would change many lives he decides to become a doc
\\
\\
Loosely inspired by the 1998 flick PATCH ADAMS [starring Robin Williams, directed by Tom Shadyac], MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. succeeds largely due to a clever screenplay, fantastic performances and most importantly, the strong emotional quotient it has to offer.
\\
\\
Making people laugh is indeed the most arduous task, but MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. assures smiles and laughter aplenty from scene A to Z. A feel-good fare, the story takes you on a journey that's rarely been depicted on Hindi screen before.
